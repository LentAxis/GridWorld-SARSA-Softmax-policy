# GridWorld
## SARSA with Softmax policy

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, which uses the GridWorld.py code to solve a Gridworld problem. The input parameters are customizable. Feel free to experiment with it. 

If you don't change anything, you will get an environment, that looks like the picture below. The blue diamond represents the startingpoint. The green one the Goal. The grey sections represent walls and act as termination conditions. That means, if our Agent steps on a wall, he will get a penalty and has to start again.

The result can be plotted like this. And yes, i'm sorry for the color choice. :)
